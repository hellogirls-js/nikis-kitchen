# From Idol Niki -> Idle Niki

## Synopsis
Niki finally quits being an idol and hopes to work in the food industry from now on. However, he loses his job at Cafe Cinammon due to his reckless actions in the past as an idol. Driven by his desire to stay in the food industry (and his stomach), he opens a new restaurant from scratch.

## How to play
Each player starts off with $200. Buy food ingredients from the right menu and serve them to customers to make money. However, be wary of the ever decreasing stomach bar. If Niki's stomach empties, then he can't serve food. Click on Niki to feed him some food from the food queue.
