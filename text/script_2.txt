Rinne: ... Eh? Why're you so quiet? Did you eat something rancid?
Niki: I <i>can't</i> work in the kitchen anymore. I got fired.

Rinne: Huh? They fired ya? Are they stupid?!
Rinne: You're my Niki-- a guy who dedicates his whole being to food!
/CHANGE/
Niki: DON'T act clueless! It's your fault I got fired in the first place!
Niki: My manager got sick of your hooligan behavior and threw me out! So I'm starting from scratch.
Niki: Now, go lay on the sofa or whatever! To think I got my hopes up 'cause I thought you were a customer...

Rinne: Eh, come on, Niki~kyun... I'm sorry! I'll make it up to ya, I promise!

Rinne: I mean, I need to yank on <i>someone's</i> ponytail during practice and Merumeru or Kohaku-chan won't cut it.
Rinne: Kyahaha~ I'm just joking. I'll seriously make it up to my Niki!
Rinne: In the meantime, why don'tcha crack open a cold one and calm down? Here!
Rinne: I gotta go do something, be right back!
