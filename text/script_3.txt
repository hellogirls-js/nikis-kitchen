/CHANGE/
Rinne: Ah, Niki-kyun~ Promise you won't get mad at li'l ol' Rinne, okay?
Rinne: I wanted to earn some big bucks for the two of us, but Lady Luck wasn't on my side today...
/CHANGE/
Niki: SO YOU BLEW ALL OF <em>MY</em> MONEY AT PACHINKO?
Niki: YOU'RE SO RECKLESS! I NEEDED THAT MONEY TO BUY FOOD INGREDIENTS!
Niki: NOW I CAN'T EVEN FEED MYSELF OR OTHER CUSTOMERS! 
Niki: What were you thinking?!
/CHANGE/
Rinne: Oi, oi! I was tryin' to do us a favor!
Rinne: If I won big, then you wouldn't need to be using your place as a make-shift take-out restaurant.
Rinne: You could have your own restaurant building!
/CHANGE/
Niki: But you didn't. Now I have no money!
Niki: I'm seriously gonna kill you!!!
Rinne: N-Niki-kyun-?! I'm choking? I'm actually gonna die?!?!

Niki: KOHAKU-CHAN!
Kohaku: Niki-han... How are ya doin'?
/CHANGE/
Niki: Kohaku-chan... Uuu... Please help me deal with this brute... 
Niki: My money is gone and it's all <em>his</em> fault...!
Kohaku: Well, that's actually why I'm here.
/CHANGE/
Kohaku: Rinne-han told me about your situation and beg--
Kohaku: I mean, threatened to beat me up and told me if I didn't help ya out then he'd turn me into meat for one of yer sandwiches.
Kohaku: Although, he didn't need to do all that.
Niki: RINNE-KUN?! Are you serious??
Rinne: That's right! Li'l brat had it good for too long, kyahaha~!
/CHANGE/
Kohaku: Anyways, yer like family to me, Niki-han, and have helped me out a lot in Crazy:B.
Kohaku: I didn't need Rinne-han to be-- beat me up in order to help ya.
Kohaku: I'm not the best in the kitchen, but two hands are better than one.
/CHANGE/
Niki: Kohaku-chan...
Niki: Are you sure, though? Aren't you busy with Crazy:B work as well as Double Face?
Kohaku: Ya know work has been slow for Crazy:B, and I do Double Face work when necessary. I promise it's okay.
Niki: Well, if that's the case...
/CHANGE/
Niki: It would be nice if we could get one more pair of hands in the kitchen.
Rinne: Ah... I have somewhere else to go!
Rinne: Bye bye, Niki-kun and Kohaku-chan~!
